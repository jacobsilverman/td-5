# techdegree-project-5

I did not alter the html or css, only the ./js/scripts.js file.

To review the project just open index.html in your browser.

Basic Spec:

✅ Gallery
- Get and display 12 random users using mockup design

✅ Modal
- Create a modal window with close feature

Exceeds Grade:

✅ Search function
- I used .filter method to implement search.

✅ Modal toggle
- Even works after filtering!

✅ Style change
- Background-color: sky blue.

Personal touch:

✅ Reset button
- After the user uses search they can get a new list with this button.

Thanks for your review!
