# techdegree-project-5

I did not alter the html or css, only the ./js/scripts.js file.

To review the project just open index.html in your browser.

Spec:
- Get and display 12 random users using mockup design ✅

- Create a modal window with close feature ✅

I went for the exceeds grade:

Search function ✅
- I used .filter method to implement search.

Modal toggle ✅
- Even works after filtering!

Style change  ✅
- Background-color: sky blue.

I also added a 'personal touch':

Reset button ✅
- After the user uses search they can get a new list with this button.

Thanks for your review!
